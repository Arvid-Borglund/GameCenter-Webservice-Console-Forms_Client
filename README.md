# GameCenter-Webservice-Console-Forms_Client
This is a scaled-down version of the GameCenter project, now provided via a web-service and consumed by an Forms client and a console client. The project(s) still provide most of the functionality for admins/ employees and it has login functionality. I strived to reuse as much of the code and program structure as I could from the original GameCenter project. 
The console client was created entirely without an IDE, and was constructed using a batch file && various files created in Notepad. 
The forms client application runs similarly to the console one using asynchronous programming, meaning I kept the required user input/ navigation at an absolute minimum, with the user only really requiring a keyboard to use the application.
In the forms client, my experimentation with using delegates in various ways can be seen. I also for both the forms and the console client (& webservice) used custom key-value-pair classes in order to send complex objects using only arrays, in order to maintain the result-set type structure expected by the db/ Enitity Framework.
